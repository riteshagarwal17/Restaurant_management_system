# Restaurant_management_system
This system is made for restaurants for managing its database and generating bills.

In this, I have provided two interfaces mainly for manager and admin.
First appears is the splash screen after which we get login screen.
We can login in only two roles i.e  manager and admin role.
Logging in as manager provides us facility of genearting bills by summing the prices of all the food items that customers have consumed.
Manager can also give discount to customer depending upon the bonus points that customer have earned in past.
So, by redeeming the bonus points customer can avail the discount.
Logging as admin provides the facillity of managing the database, view all the information and upadte the prices of category of fooditems.
Admin can do many operations on database of fooditems as required.
This system is built by keeping the real needs and sytems in mind.
